 Password Strength Checker

This project is a simple Python script that checks the strength of a password based on various criteria, including:

* Length (at least 8 characters)
* Uppercase and lowercase letters
* Digits
* Special characters
* Avoidance of common passwords

The script assigns a strength score to the password and provides feedback to the user, such as "Very Strong," "Strong," "Moderate," "Weak," or "Very Weak."

 How it works

The script uses regular expressions and built-in Python functions to analyze the password and determine its strength. It also includes a list of common passwords to avoid.

 Usage

1. Run the script.
2. Enter your password when prompted.
3. The script will output the strength of your password.
